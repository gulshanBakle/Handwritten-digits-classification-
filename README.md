# Handwritten digits classification

It was my first deep learning project based on classification of handwritten digits on MNIST dataset. The dataset was taken from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. It was an attempt to learn various deep learning concepts. Entire implementation was done using Pytorch and MatPlotLib. Training the model for just 3 epochs and Adam optimizer, gave an accuracy of 98.81%.
